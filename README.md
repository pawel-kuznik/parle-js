#parle.js 

An event systen written in ES2015 with babel for tranpiling into ES5.

Why another event system? Well, I needed a event system for some funny stuff 
done on my little raspberry Ï€. And I found Signal-Js, EventEmmiter and couple 
of others options. But they all present little bit different ideas. So, 
I was in dilema. At the end I almost used EventEmmiter for my events needs. 
But, just before I decided on them I started reading articles about ES2015
and how cool it is. So immediately I had some fun one evening and this lib
was created.

Keep in mind that this library is no super stable, highly optimized 
production product with extremly expensive license. It's just something
that I wrote cause I wanted some kind event system and wanted to play
with ES2015 a little.
